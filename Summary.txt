During my limited time with KUMC's Biostatistics department this summer, I was able to work with professor Mihaela Sardiu and take part in her research. She granted me the opportunity to work with real clinical data and take part in the processing and understanding of this data for use in her study.
Under her guidance, I have gained an understanding of proteomics and experience using the R scripting language for data processing and written or used many tools for a variety of data processing needs. 
Professor Sardiu was kind enough to walk me through a wide array of data processing tasks. From simple programs created to filter spreadsheets and to fit our specific needs, to machine learning algorithms to train off our data and make predictions about protein complexes, as well as clustering and other tools to help visualize our data in a more meaningful manner. Professor Sardiu walked me through 
This position has given me the opportunity to earn a real world understanding of biostatistics and a chance to learn about the workflow of biostatistics research, take part in it, and become familiar with many commonly used tools and packages.
I have had a wonderful experience working at KUMC and everyone in the biostatistics department, especially Professor Sardiu, who has generously given her time to make sure that I make the most of my two months at the hospital.
