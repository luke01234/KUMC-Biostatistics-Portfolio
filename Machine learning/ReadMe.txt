This directory contains all the machine learning processing done by me.

We used several algorithms for our analysis of data. 

1)  We began by using a boosting algorithm, the script for which can be found in the "R" directory.

2)  We then used a random forest algorithm that can be found in the same directory

3)  Finally Bayes Model was used, found in the same directory

These were used to predict protein complexes given the data from our input files.

We ran these algorithms with two input files, one being the replicate ds averages for the proteins, and the other being the topological scores of the proteins and compared the outcomes of both
both input files can be found in the "input files" directory.

The outputs were then compared and it was shown that using the topological scores made for a better prediction of protein complexes.
