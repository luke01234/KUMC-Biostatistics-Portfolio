This file contains the scripts used for machine learning.

THESE SCRIPTS WERE NOT WRITTEN BY ME 
I simply adapted them to work with our data.

1)  "boosting.R" uses a boosting algorithm, the input file MUST have the predicted value denoted as pos and neg rather than 1 and 0.

2)  "random forest.R" a random forest approach to predicting protein complexes.
