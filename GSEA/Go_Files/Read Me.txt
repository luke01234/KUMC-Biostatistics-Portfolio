This folder contains the Go_Files used inside the GSEA function.

These files were retreived from here: https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp and here https://github.com/broadinstitute/ssGSEA2.0/blob/master/db/msigdb/c5.bp.v7.0.symbols.gmt

The Go_File that was chosen during each run would determine which gene activity pathways would be analyzed by the GSEA function.

For the most part we opted to use the "c5.bp.v7.0.symbols.gmt" file.
